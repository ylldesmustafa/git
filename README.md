## Exercise Instructions

* Copy the html and css from the following [codepen](https://codepen.io/ayunas-the-scripter/pen/NWRJbKJ) and paste it in the new cloned folder.  Create two files for the html and css, `index.html` , and `index.css`
* Create a new file using the command line called notes.txt
* Add some text to the notes.txt file.
* Create a new branch called html-branch
* Move the html & css file to the html-branch and leave the notes.txt file in the master branch
* Add three &lt;p&gt; tags with "lorem ipsum" paragraph text to the html file, which should now be on the html-branch.  You can find "lorem ipsum" at the following link : https://loremipsum.io/
* Save your changes, then add, commit and push your files up to the html-branch repository on github. Make sure you add a descriptive message for your commit.
* Refresh your repository on GitHub to make sure your file was uploaded and the html-branch was updated.
* Create another branch called text-branch
* Move the notes.txt from master to the text-branch. The master branch should now be completely empty at this point, aside from the README file and the data.json file.
* Check the status, add, commit and push your changes to the text-branch.  Make sure you add a descriptive message for your commit.
* Add 3 additional lorem-ipsum paragraphs into the notes.txt file which should now be on the text-branch.
* Commit and push your additional changes to the text-branch on GitHub.  Make sure you add a descriptive message for your commit.
* On GitHub, verify that the master branch only has the README.md file and the data.json file with nothing else.  Verify that the html-branch only has the `index.html` and `index.css` files and the text-branch only has the .txt file.
Submit a pull request for both the html-branch and the text-branch to be merged into master.  Add your TA as a collaborator for both Pull Requests (PR).
